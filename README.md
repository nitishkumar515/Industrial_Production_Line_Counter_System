# Industrial_Production_Line_Counter_System
## Aim 

In this project, I aim to Design and build a Production Line Counter System  using smart sensor to fully embrace automation. This methodology can be implemented in any Industry. The method uses Industrial Automation systems and smart sensors to maintain and bring the accuracy over counting. This method is cost efficient and can be easily implemented. I am implementing this all on riscv processor rather than arduino board.
